    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard. The top section contains an introduction, a summary doughnut chart showing translation frequencies, and filter buttons. The main content area is a responsive grid of 'verse cards', each displaying a specific occurrence and its six translations. This structure was chosen to provide both a high-level summary (the chart) and detailed, comparable data (the cards). The filtering allows users to dynamically query the dataset based on translation category, which is the primary analytical task this app supports. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Table of verses and translations. -> Goal: Compare translations and see frequency. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive card grid for comparison, Doughnut Chart (Chart.js) for frequency. -> Interaction: Filter buttons highlight relevant cards. -> Justification: This combined approach addresses both macro (frequency) and micro (verse-by-verse comparison) analysis of the source data in a highly interactive and intuitive way. -> Library/Method: Chart.js for the chart; HTML/Tailwind/JS for the interactive card grid. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                        The Greek phrase <span class="font-mono">τοῦ πονηροῦ</span> appears throughout the New Testament. Its translation often varies, carrying different theological nuances. Sometimes it's rendered as a personal being (like "the evil one"), and other times as an abstract concept (like "evil"). This interactive tool allows you to see these differences across major English translations. Use the filters below to highlight verses based on the translation category, and explore the cards for a side-by-side comparison.
